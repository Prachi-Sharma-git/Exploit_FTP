# Exploit_FTP
Python exploit for the vsftpd 2.3.4 (CVE-2011-2523)
vsftpd, which stands for Very Secure FTP Daemon,is an FTP server for Unix-like systems, including Linux. 
In July 2011, it was discovered that vsftpd version 2.3.4 downloadable from the master site had been compromised. 
Users logging into a compromised vsftpd-2.3.4 server may issue a :) smileyface as the username and gain a command shell on port 6200. 
This was not an issue of a security hole in vsftpd, instead, someone had uploaded a different version of vsftpd which contained a backdoor. 
Since then, the site was moved to Google App Engine.
